# CarWhispering
 Car Whispering: the AI Mechanic  TinyML Audio Event Detection
 
### CarWhispering is currently reliant on the EdgeImpulse model created by me which I have published publicly via their site: [AIMechanic Trained Model](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/69300)

## What is this?
* This is a trained model to identify issues which typically dont throw error codes. The type of issue that a trained proffessional mechanic could identify by listening.

## What do I need to run it?
* Currently you will need an AI Kit containing an [Arduino BLE Sense 33](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) and also a Grove LCD Display

## What model engine will it work with?
*  I have the commonly used M54 which was in most petrol BMW cars from 2000-2006 and was only a minor upgrade from the M52 from 1993 but any BMW 6 Cylinder engine should work.

## Deploying
*Maven or a similar deployment will be implemented, along will a build pipeline and test. Apologies but for now please refer to the [Arduino Quickstart]([Arduino BLE Sense 33](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense))
